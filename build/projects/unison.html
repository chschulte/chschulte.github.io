<h2>Unison: Robust, Scalable, and Open Code Generation by Combinatorial Problem Solving</h2>

<p>
Today's compilers typically generate code in stages: instruction
selection (choose appropriate instructions for the program being
compiled) is followed by register allocation (assign variables to
registers or memory) and instruction scheduling (order
instructions to improve throughput). Each stage commonly executes
an approximation algorithm as taking optimal decisions is
computationally infeasible in general. Both staging and
approximation compromise the quality of the generated code and
preclude optimal code generation.
</p>

<p>
This project proposes a radical departure in that the various
tasks for code generation are translated into models of
combinatorial problems and the resulting models are solved in
unison by constraint programming as a modern method for
combinatorial optimization. The models are generated with respect
to the program to be translated and a high-level description of
the target architecture.
</p>

<p>
The challenge in this project is to devise an approach and
techniques such that code generation is correct and simple,
robust and scalable, potentially optimal, retargetable and open,
and widely applicable.
</p>

<p>
The project's research is significant as it is the first
integrated approach to compilation using combinatorial
optimization that combines robustness with scalability while
using the very same combinatorial models. Previous approaches do
not scale and resort to several models to achieve robustness
which is error prone and sacrifices simplicity.

The project is funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR)
under grant 621-2011-6229, 2012&ndash;2014. Volume: 2400 KSEK,
role: principal investigator.
</p>

<p>
The project is conducted in close collaboration with a project on constraint-based compilation at SICS (Swedish Institute of Computer Science) also lead by Christian Schulte and funded by LM Ericsson AB.

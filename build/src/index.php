    <p>
    Christian Schulte is a professor of computer science at the unit
    <a href="http://www.kth.se/en/ict/forskning/scs"
    >Software and Computer Systems</a>,
    <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/eecs"
    >School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kth.se/"
    >KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in
    Stockholm, Sweden. He is a member of the <a href="https://www.kth.se/scs/mcs">Model-based Computing Systems (MCS)</a> research group. He is also program director for the graduate program "Information and Communication Technology".
    </p>

    <p>
    Christian also works as expert researcher at the <a
    href="http://www.sics.se/csl">Computer Systems Laboratory</a>
    of the <a href="http://www.sics.se/">Swedish Institute of
    Computer Science (RISE SICS)</a>.
    </p>


    <p>
    Before joining KTH in 2002, he got a diploma in computer
    science (with a minor in mathematics) from
    the University of Karlsruhe, Germany (1992), worked as a researcher
    and project leader at the German Research Center for Artificial
    Intelligence (DFKI) (1992-1997) and as a researcher at
    Saarland University, Germany (1997-2002), from which he also obtained
    a doctoral degree in engineering (2001). At KTH, he earned a docent degree in computer systems in 2009.
    </p>

    <p>
    His research interests include constraint programming, programming systems,  and distributed systems.
    </p>

    <p>
    His current research focus is on <a href="projects/unison.html">constraint-based compilation</a> and on models, architectures,
    and implementation techniques for constraint programming
    systems. Please check out a post on Ericsson's research blog about <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/outperforming-state-art-compilers-unison/">Unison</a>, the joint KTH, RISE SICS, and Ericsson project in constraint-based code generation. Christian is heading the development of 
    <a href="software.html#gecode">Gecode</a> as an attempt
    to construct an open, free, portable, accessible, and efficient
    environment for developing constraint-based systems and applications.
